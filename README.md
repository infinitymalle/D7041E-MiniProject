# Installations
- Pytorch
- Dataset is imported in the code

# Link to Youtube video: 


# Result
Performances of models with different number of hidden layers for different cost/loss functions:

Cross-Entropy Loss
- 0 Hidden layers: 97.5% 
- 2 Hidden layers: 96.95%
- 4 Hidden layers: 97.64%

Negative Log-Likelihood Loss
- 0 Hidden layers: 97.71% 
- 2 Hidden layers: 97.0%
- 4 Hidden layers: 97.29%

# Run the code
Remeber to comment out the LogSoftMax as explained in the video. Otherwise it is just to run the code.
